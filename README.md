# Languages I know / learning / want to learn 

* Javascript (more experience in it) + (i know React)
* Typescript (Javascript but with a few extra steps to it that I have to learn)
* HTML
* CSS
* SCSS (i like using brackets rather than spaces **cough** SASS **cough** **cough**)
* Svelte (after watching [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv3Yq-B8qp4), I kinda wanna learn it based on how easy and simple it looks compared to React)
* PHP (eh so-so)
* Dart (i don't really know Flutter but the actual language itself)
* Nim (trying to learn)
* Haxe (i've tested the waters)
* D (seems very interesting)
* Rust & Go (i've been forced to look at it by Reddit, memes, and the increasing amount of GitHub repos that have used it)
* Perl (alternative to bash?) + (might not do)
* C# (MonoGame/Unity/Windows opportunities?)
* Python (apparently its becoming the industry standard so I have to learn it even if using spaces instead of brackets gives me anxiety)
* Scala (seems like a better alternative to Java, a language im trying to avoid at all costs)

# My thoughts / opinions
 `I like terminals over gui (sometimes)`
 `I should really learn some more programming languages`
 `sudo apt install is better than using .exe`
 `Can someone ever truely know CSS as a language?`
 `Is Rust that good?`
 `More people should try to learn Linux`
 `Why am I learning C# when I'm not even using Windows where it's better supported?`
