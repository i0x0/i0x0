# My thoughts / opinions
 `I like terminals over gui (sometimes)`
 `I should really learn some more programming languages`
 `sudo apt install is better than using .exe`
 `Can someone ever truely know CSS as a language?`
 `Is Rust that good?`
 `More people should try to learn Linux`
 `Why am I learning C# when I'm not even using Windows where it's better supported?`
